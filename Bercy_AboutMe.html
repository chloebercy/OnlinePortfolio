                        <p style="text-size:25px; font-family: Playfair Display"> Hi, my name is Chloe Bercy. I have recently deveopled an interest in comuter science. Although I am still relatively young, I intend to pursue a career in computer science later on in life. Hopefully, my passion will open opportunities to develop my skill set in computer engineering. A main reason why I got into computer science is because I believe that the development of this field will have a signifcant impact on our lifestyles in the future. To find a career in engineering, I have begun taking engineering courses (such as Computer Science and Software Engineering and Principles Of Engineering). As a personal project, I have also decided to create a website for a local Chinese school to improve their marketing strategy.  </p>
                        <p style="text-size:25px; font-family: Playfair Display"> Although I have yet to experience an internship or employement in the computer science field, I have work experience in other engineering fields such as architecture and manufacturing. By working in professional environments, I have learnt the importance of innitiative. My work experiences has strengthened my own drive to work efficiently and improve my skills, from communicating professionally to filling paperwork. I am eager to continue developing my skills and gaining valuable work experiences. I am unsure of my path after college, but I am excited about exploring my options.</p>
                        <p style="text-size:25px; font-family: Playfair Display"> I am currently a sophmore at Dublin High School. As an individual with an international background from North America, Europe and Asia, I am adaptable to new enviroments, expectations and people. I owe my world view and ability to work well with people of various backgrounds and beliefs to my experiences living abroad.</p>                  
                        <p style="text-size:25px; font-family: Playfair Display"> Thank you for reading a little about me, feel free to take a look at my resume or previous projects.
