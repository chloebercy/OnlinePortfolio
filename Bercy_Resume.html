                    <p> As I begin to approach attending college and eventually entering the workforce, I am currently gaining new work experience, skills and knowledge through field trips, speakers, internships and jobs.</p>
                    <p> From the field trips that I have attended, my trip to SAP, a company that sells enterprise software to companies, has been the most useful. Not only was I introduced to a large engineering company, but I was also given the opportunity to learn about appropriate and effective communication in the workplace. Presenters at this field trip covered topics such as how to give a compelling "elevator pitch", the importance of a follow-up email to receive advice from professionals, and what social intelligence looks like. I have applied this knowledge to how I practice work etiquette. I have improved the way I email teachers, managers and how I present myself to interviewers or other professionals. </p>
                    <p> Other influential speakers that has inspired me are a material testing manager and a contract engineer named Dan Cherner and Natalina Dernarai. Their presentation talked about the realistics of how to get an engineering degree, what a starting engineering job looks like, and most memorably the transition from engineering to business. They explained their process of starting as a civil engineer to becoming upper managers. This has lasted with me because they emphasized on how to grow in a corporate business from being an engineer.  </p>    
                    <p>I have also gained first-hand work experience with internships and jobs. During my internship for an architecture firm, I have learned how to complete assignments out of my comfort zone and the appropriate way to ask for help. At my current employment working for Kumon, I learned the importance of being friendly and approachable to your coworkers and managers, especially in a large company. It is difficult to stand out in a sea of employees; however, I have learned the power giving off good impressions to stand out.</p>
